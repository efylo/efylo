# Commands

## cd

"cd", which stands for change directory, is the most frequently used command to me when using git bash. 

```shell
# change directory to "c\users\user_id\dir"
cd c/users/user_id/dir
# change directory to home directory, "c\users\user_id\", (maybe? default)
cd ~
# change directory which is child of the home direcroty, "~\dir2" 
# (~ stands for home)
cd ~/dir2
# change directory up one level, "c\users\user_id\"
cd ..
# change directory to previous directory, "c\users\user_id\dir2"
cd -
```
